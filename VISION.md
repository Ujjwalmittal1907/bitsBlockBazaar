2. **Fraud & Wash Trading**:
   - Sophisticated market manipulation techniques
   - Difficulty in identifying suspicious trading patterns
   - Need for real-time fraud detection systems
   - Temporal pattern analysis challenges

3. **Valuation Complexity**:
   - Absence of standardized valuation metrics
   - Difficulty in assessing true NFT worth
   - Limited understanding of value drivers
   - Time-sensitive pricing dynamics

4. **Data Fragmentation**:
   - Scattered data across multiple marketplaces
   - Inconsistent data formats and standards
   - Need for unified analytics platform
   - Real-time data synchronization issues
